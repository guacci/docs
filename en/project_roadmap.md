# Project Roadmap - guacci

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the development stages of the guacci's MVP, which focuses on establishing an automated security system for our neighborhood. The MVP will enable neighbors to report incidents and receive real-time alerts using accessible tools like WhatsApp and a simple web or mobile app.

## Phases of Development

### Phase 1: Setup Reporting and Alerts System
- **Objective**: Create a basic system where neighbors can report incidents and receive alerts in real-time.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Develop a simple web or mobile application for incident reporting.
  - Implement a WhatsApp bot for receiving and sending alerts.
  - Create a dedicated WhatsApp group for emergency communication.
- **Outcome**: A functioning system that allows for easy reporting of suspicious activities and quick communication among residents.

### Phase 2: Monitoring and Continuous Improvement
- **Objective**: Collect feedback and make improvements to the system based on user experience.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Gather feedback from users on the ease of use and effectiveness of the reporting and alert system.
  - Make necessary adjustments to the application, WhatsApp bot, and monitoring processes.
- **Outcome**: An improved and optimized security system that meets the needs of the neighborhood.

## Future Phases (Post-MVP)

### Phase 3: Integration of Intelligent Cameras
- Explore the integration of AI-powered cameras for automated monitoring and detection.

### Phase 4: Drone Surveillance Implementation
- Implement drone surveillance for patrolling common areas and responding to incidents.

### Phase 5: Advanced Data Analysis and Prediction
- Develop data analysis capabilities to predict and prevent potential security threats.

## Conclusion

This roadmap serves as a guide for the initial development of the Guardda/Guacci security system. Each phase focuses on building a foundation for a scalable and effective security solution, ensuring safety and peace of mind for all residents.
